### No departure board looks like this.
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/24/nyregion/penn-station-departure-board.html
This is what happens when trying to cram MomentJS practice into Firebase. I get the point, but it's so far from being realistic that I experienced student disconnect. 

Still, I want to make it more realistic eventually. This is very much a V1 attempt. Time sucked away by defensive driving (and I'm still not done) and my own personal conflict with this homework.
My issues:
1) no board would be at the mercy of someone's spelling. Imagine Poughkeepsie or Waxahachie. They'd be drop-down menus or typeahead. 
2) Train lines are already done and set probably months if not years ago. A station master's job would be to edit departure and arrival time or cancel without it affecting the next day's line.

Future todos:
I hope to return to this to address the challenges I faced when I have more time (and no looming speeding ticket.)
* I want to have lines associated with end stations. 
* I got typeahead to work but then I could not select from the options, especially when I was at Pen and had Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Pennsacola, Florida; or Penn Station. It's a great challenge to tackle, but I need more than a week. 
* I want to have the lines already there in a drop-down or a spinner.
* I want to cancel departures or lines for the day without cancelling the line. Think incident or severe weather.
* go get more MomentJS practice in, I want to show time to next station (oh, and show next station) and time to end station.
